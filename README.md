## **1. Overview**
PyBer is a ride -sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. The first part of the project consisted on analyze all the ride-share data from January to early May of 2019 and create a visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize.

The second part of the project consist on create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type creating a visualization with the obtained results, that will explain how the data differs by city type.

### **3.1 Results of Summary of ride-sharing data**
In order to obtain the summary of the information, it was require to obtain the totals of 5 different categories;

- Total rides for each city type.
- Total drivers for each city type.
- Total amount of fares for each city type.
- Average fare per ride for each city type.
- Average fare per driver for each city type.

The results can be found on the following table:

|   | Total Rides  |  Total Drivers | Total Fares | Average Fare per Ride | Average Fare per Driver |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Rural**  | 125  | 78  | $4,327.93  | $34.62  | $55.49  |
| **Suburban**  | 625  | 490  | $19,356.33  | $30.97  | $39.50  |
| **Urban**  | 1,625  | 2,405  | $39,854.38   | $24.53  | $16.57  |

#### **3.1.1 Analysis**
As observed, the total rides on Urban cities is :white_check_mark: 2.6 times higher than Suburban cities and :white_check_mark: 13 times higher than Rural cities. In consequence, Urban cities provide the highest revenue with a total of **$39,854.38** which is twice the revenue generated by Suburban cities.

It is also important to note that, the Average Fare per Ride and per Driver on Rural cities is higher than the other city types; this is coo-related to the total of Drivers, which is less, and the demand of service required on that type of city. For Rural cities, the Average Fare per ride is :white_check_mark: 1.4 times higher than Urban cities, with a total of **$34.62**.


Once we have the global picture, we need to focus our attention to the period between January and early May 2019.

*Examples of code used during the analysis*

```
# 5. Create a new DataFrame from the pivot table DataFrame using loc on the given dates, '2019-01-01':'2019-04-29'.

total_fare_Jan_Apr_df = total_fare_per_date_pivot.loc['2019-01-01':'2019-04-28']
total_fare_Jan_Apr_df

# 8. Create a new DataFrame using the "resample()" function by week 'W' and get the sum of the fares for each week.
weekly_fares_df = total_fare_Jan_Apr_df.resample('W').sum()
weekly_fares_df.head(10)

```

After the analysis, the results were displayed on the following chart:

![PyBer Summary](https://github.com/amonjaras/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

We can notice that:

- All cities increase the total fare by late February
- Urban cities had the highest revenue :white_check_mark:, even though we can observe some fluctuations between late February and early April.
- There is an increase of revenue for Suburban cities between mid February and early March :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- Rural cities reaches the maximum fare, **$500** on April and decrease by mid April.

## **4. Summary**
Here some recommendations:

1. Since Urban cities have the highest demand and highest revenue, PyBer should consider investing on advertising to help drivers to increase their fare.

2. For Suburban cities, PyBer could consider the use of incentives to increase the demand on this type of cities.

3. Rural cities, PyBer can consider the increase of drivers, it is observed that service is required in almost a constant phase. Fluctuation could be due to lesser offer to high demand.
